# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of this Educational Technology Plan is for Sunnyside students in grades 6-8 will conceptionally understand the structure of a Computer Science course, and get exposure to careers in Computer Science. Computer Science will allow Sunnyside students to gain life skills by focusing on problem-solving and programming, with the expectation that students will be inspired to be creative. 

## Context

### Course

The course will be Computer Science 1 focusing on practice and concepts, as well as in other content areas such as, Math and Science for grades 6-8. This course will meet four days a week for a 30 minute class period, each trimester. 

### Situation

Sunnyside Union Elementary School District is a one K-8 school district, serving 368 students and it is located in a rural area in Tulare County. This district's average testing ranking is 1/10, which is in the bottom 50% of public schools in California. Sunnyside Union Elementary School District, which is ranked within the bottom 50% of all 989 school districts in California (based off of combined math and reading proficiency testing data) for the 2018-2019 school year. Sunnyside Union Elementary School District have an average math proficiency score of 15% (versus the California public school average of 40%), and reading proficiency score of 26% (versus the 51% statewide average). 
Minority enrollment is 91% of the student body (majority Hispanic), which is more than the California public school average of 77% (majority Hispanic). Also, 78.5% of students are economically disadvantaged, 48% of students are female, and 52% of students are male. 51.1% of students are English language learners. Sunnyside is a Title 1 school district and all students receive a free lunch. 

Sunnyside does not have a computer lab on campus. Last year, due to the pandemic the district went 1:1, issuing Chromebooks to 6th and 7th grade students, and 8th grade students were issued Macbooks. Due to rural location students experience slow wifi connection. The district does provide hotspots but even still students experience slow wifi interruptions.

### Application

Computer Science 1 will be an introductory computer science course for 6 - 8th grade students. Sunnyside students will choose to learn through video based lessons with different themes like sports, art, and game design. It will also include hands-on lessons and block-based coding in Scratch. Through a series of real world scenarios, projects and challenges, students are introduced to foundational concepts that they will return to repeatedly throughout the course. 

This introductory Computer Science course would begin by having students creating code to tell a story. Students would have a choice on what type of story they would want to tell using code. Learning the basics of coding using Scratch by story telling will engage the student and capture their interest, in telling their story. A form of communication without the student actually speaking. Collaborative in that peers will interact with the story to provide feedback as to what could help the story move forward. Students can begin with setting up characters, move on to setting, then on to dialogue, and finally plot. These story elements through computer science would significantly deepen comprehension and English language development in listening, reading, writing, and speaking. 

Curriculum will incorporate the Visible Learning Model which is surface, deep, and transfer. Surface learning is a time when students initially are exposed to concepts, skills, and strategies. Deep learning as a period when students consolidate their understanding and apply and extend some surface learning knowledge to support deeper conceptual understanding. Transfer learning is the point at which students take their consolidated knowledge and skills and apply what they know to new scenarios and different contexts. It is also a time when students are able to think metacognitively, reflecting on their own learning and understanding. 


### Impacts

Computer Science will be essential because it will help equip Sunnyside students to develop their critical thinking skills, and thus become informed individuals in a society where technology is expanding so quickly. Sunnyside students are strongly unmotivated in their learning and lack communication skills. Many come from disadvantaged homes with little opportunity to communicate, which is why many in the classroom choose to stay unseen. The majority of Sunnyside students are identified as English language learners, and the visual of a Computer Science course, would deepen their conceptial understanding. The simplicty of giving students a choice in their learning can intrinsically motivate and engage them to learn and capture their interest. Sunnyside students are not customary in having a choice in their learning. Computer Science as a choice can provide for opportunity to collaborate with peers, provide constructive feedback, and work towards a common goal. By demonstrating that Computer Science has been a trial and error field, will help students understand that mistakes are acceptable, and it is also a form of communication. This course will empower students to engage with computer science as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun.
