# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of this Educational Technology Plan is for Sunnyside students in grades 6-8 will conceptionally understand the structure of a Computer Science course, and get exposure to careers in Computer Science. Computer Science will allow Sunnyside students to gain life skills by focusing on problem-solving and programming, with the expectation that students will be inspired to be creative. 

## Context

### Course

The course will be Computer Science 1 focusing on practice and concepts6, as well as in other content areas such as, Math and Science for grades 6-8. This course will meet four days a week for a 30 minute class period, each trimester. 

### Situation

Sunnyside Union Elementary School District is a one K-8 school district, serving 368 students and it is located in a rural area in Tulare County. This district's average testing ranking is 1/10, which is in the bottom 50% of public schools in California. Sunnyside Union Elementary School District, which is ranked within the bottom 50% of all 989 school districts in California (based off of combined math and reading proficiency testing data) for the 2018-2019 school year. Sunnyside Union Elementary School District have an average math proficiency score of 15% (versus the California public school average of 40%), and reading proficiency score of 26% (versus the 51% statewide average). Minority enrollment is 91% of the student body (majority Hispanic), which is more than the California public school average of 77% (majority Hispanic). Also, 78.5% of students are economically disadvantaged, 48% of students are female, and 52% of students are male. 51.1% of students are English language learners. Sunnyside is a Title 1 school district and all students receive a free lunch. 

Sunnyside does have a computer lab on campus. Last year, due to the pandemic the district went 1:1, issuing Chromebooks to 6th and 7th grade students, and 8th grade students were issued Macbooks. Due to rural location students experience slow wifi connection. The district does provide hotspots but even still students experience slow wifi interruptions.

### Application

Computer Science will be an introductory computer science course for 6 - 8th grade students. Mapped to CS standards, computer science will be covering topics such as problem solving, programming, user centered design, and data. Daily lesson plans made up of inquiry-based activities, videos, assessments, and computing tools. The Problem Solving unit is a highly interactive and collaborative introduction to the field of computer science. Through a series of puzzles, challenges, and real world scenarios, students are introduced to a problem solving process and learn how computers input, output, store, and process information. 

### Impacts

Computer Science is essential because it will help equip student to develop critical thinking skills, and thus become informed individuals in a society where technology is expanding so quickly. Intrinsically motivated students will be engaged to learn and providing students choice in their learning will capture their interest. Lessons will include academic discourse, peer feedback, and presentations. All students can succeed in computer science when given the adequate supports and opportunities, regardless of prior knowledge. Curriculum will incorporate the Visible Learning Model which is surface, deep, and transfer. Surface learning is a time when students initially are exposed to concepts, skills, and strategies. Deep learning as a period when students consolidate their understanding and apply and extend some surface learning knowledge to support deeper conceptual understanding. Transfer learning is the point at which students take their consolidated knowledge and skills and apply what they know to new scenarios and different contexts. (Hattie, Fisher and Frey - Visible Learning 2017). It is also a time when students are able to think metacognitively, reflecting on their own learning and understanding.
